Monte Carlo Dice Simulation

Purpose: This program was made to test python multiprocessing in the context of Monte Carlo simulations.

Description: 
Monte Carlo simulation of a dice game. The dice game involves two dices, and the dices are rolled a set 
number of times. When the two dices are the same number, the player wins 4 times his bet amount, otherwise the player loses his bet.
The user of this program can decide the number of games this program simulates (number of simulations), the number of dice rolls 
for each simulation/game, and the amount to bet.

Install and Run:
1. Install the required python packages using: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the program using: python ./main.py
